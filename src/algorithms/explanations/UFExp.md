# Union Find

---

The Union Find data structure is also known as a Disjoint Set. It is a data
structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of
disjoint subsets. It supports two operations:

- `find`: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used
  for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
- `union`: Join two subsets into a single subset.
